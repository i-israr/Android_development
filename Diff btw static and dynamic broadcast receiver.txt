1) Static Registration

Implementation are in manifest, android system can initiate processes and run your boardcast 
receiver at any time. One example like you want to update your data when a new intent coming in from system
or etc.. You need to take care Security issue as well.

2) Dynamic Registration

Implementation are in java code, boardcast receiver runs only when your app is running up to 
that registration line. Thus, you mostly want to use this if you only want to bring up the 
boardcast receiver with certain conditions.
